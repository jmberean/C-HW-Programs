 1. Write a switch statement with a selector expression of type day (see Example 7.6) that displays a message indicating the corresponding
 day of the week followed by the message " is a weekday" or " is a weekend day".
 
 For example, if the selector expression value is Sunday, the message "Sunday is a weekend day" should be displayed.
 
 
 
 
 // Function prototypes
 void writeColor(color); color readColor();
 int main() {
 color eyeColor, hairColor;
 cout << "Reading eye color" << endl;
 eyeColor = readColor();
 cout << endl << "Reading hair color" << endl;
 hairColor = readColor();
 cout << endl << "Eye color is ";
 writeColor(eyeColor);
 cout << ", hair color is ";
 writeColor(hairColor);
 cout << endl;
 return 0; }
 // Insert functions readColor and writeColor here.
