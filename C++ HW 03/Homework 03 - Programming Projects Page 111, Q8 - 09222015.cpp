    8.  Arnie likes to jog in the morning.
        As he jogs, he counts the number of strides he makes during the first minute
        and then again during the last minute of his jogging.
 
        Arnie then averages these two and calls this average the number of strides he makes in a minute when he jogs.
 
        Write a program that accepts this average and the total time Arnie spends jogging
        in hours and minutes and then displays the distance Arnie has jogged in miles.
 
 Assume Arnieâ€™s stride is 2.5 feet (also a data item).
 There are 5280 feet in a mile (a constant). */
