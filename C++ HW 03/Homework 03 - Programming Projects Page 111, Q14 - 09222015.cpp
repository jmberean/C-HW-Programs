       14.  Write a program that asks a user to enter the distance of a trip in miles,
            the miles per gallon estimate for the userâ€™s car, 
            and the average cost of a gallon of gas. 
            
            Your program should calculate and display the number
            of gallons of gas needed and the estimated cost of the trip. */
