 3. Assume your friend has solved Programming Exercise 2. Write another function that uses your friendâ€™s function to calculate the speed (km/h) one must average to reach a certain destination by a designated time.
 
 Function inputs include
 
 same-day departure and
 arrival times
 
 as integers on a 24-hour clock and
 
 the distance to the destination in kilometers.
 
 
 
 Also write a driver program to test your function.
